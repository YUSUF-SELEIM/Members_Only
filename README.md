## Introduction

Welcome to MembersOnly, a vibrant platform empowering users to share messages seamlessly. This application is meticulously crafted using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js),NextJs and Socket.IO guaranteeing a modern development experience. Additionally, I've implemented session-based authentication using Passport.js, ensuring secure access and personalized interactions for our users.

## Features

- 📫 Post and view posts on a user-friendly interface.
- 🔄 Real-time updates with automatic message refreshing using Socket.IO.
- ⚙️ MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for a well-organized backend.
- 🔄 Monorepo structure for combined backend and frontend development.
- 🌐 Database storage powered by MongoDB for efficient data handling.
- ⚡️ Fast and responsive frontend using React and Vite.
